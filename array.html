    <h1> Array (Collection, List)</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Wikipedia:</b> Generally, a collection of data items that can
      be selected by indices computed at run-time.
    </p>

    <p>
      An array, in its simplest form, is a collection of things (elements).
    </p>

    <p>
      An array keeps its elements inside of a left bracket and a
      right bracket, like this: <code>[]</code>
    </p>


    <p>
      Let's create a new array with 0 elements and assign it to
      the variable <code>emptyArray</code>.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
var emptyArray = [];
</code>
</pre>
</div>


    <p>
      The variable <code>emptyArray</code> is now referencing a new array with 0 elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      In theory, an array can contain infinite elements. In reality, however,
      the number of elements in an array is limited by the memory of the
      computer. Each element inside of an array is separated by a comma.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
var newArray = [thing1, thing2, thing3, thing4];
</code>
</pre>
</div>


    <p>
      A practical example of an array would be a collection of people.
      Let's say we have group of friends who are allergic to nuts. We would like
      to keep track of the people with this allergy so that can we make sure they
      are never served nuts.
    </p>


<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
var sam = new Person();
var alex = new Person();
var dylan = new Person();
var hunter = new Person();

var peopleAllergicToNuts = [sam, alex, dylan, hunter];
</code>
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      We now have an array containing all of our friends who
      are allergic to nuts. Instead of asking everyone the next
      time we order lunch, we can just take a look at our array.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessing elements in an array</h2>

    <p>
      In order to figure out which of our friends are allergic to nuts,
      we need a way to retrieve the elements from our array.
      The elements of an array are accessed with a special property
      called an <u>index</u>. An index is nothing more than the numeric
      position of an element. The only catch is that this index doesn't
      start at 1, it starts at 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's try and access the first person who is allergic to nuts and
      assign it to a new variable, <code>firstAllergicPerson</code>.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
var firstAllergicPerson = peopleAllergicToNuts[0]; <span class="comment">// sam</span>
</code>
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      Notice the <u>syntax</u>. We're using the name of the variable referencing
      our array, <code>peopleAllergicToNuts</code> followed by <code>[0]</code>. The brackets
      tell our array that we're attempting to access an element.
      The 0 is the index of the element we're attempting to access
      (remember, our indices begin at 0, not 1).
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
peopleAllergicToNuts[0]; <span class="comment">// sam</span>
peopleAllergicToNuts[1]; <span class="comment">// alex</span>
peopleAllergicToNuts[2]; <span class="comment">// dylan</span>
peopleAllergicToNuts[3]; <span class="comment">// hunter</span>
peopleAllergicToNuts[4]; <span class="comment">// ?????? (UH OH)</span>
</code>
</pre>
</div>


    <h3>????? (UH OH)</h3>

    <p>
      There are times when you'll attempt to access an element that
      doesn't exist (the last line in the example above). This can
      be very problematic. Certain programs will crash, while others
      will just put your code in an unstable state. We'll go over
      ways to prevent this later. In the meantime, don't do it.
    </p>



    <h2>Adding elements to an array</h2>

    <p>
      Often you'll find yourself wanting to add new elements to an
      array. Say we discover than our other friend, Casey, is also
      allergic to nuts. There are a few ways add new elements to
      an array. One way is to use an explicit index.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
var casey = new Person();
peopleAllergicToNuts[4] = casey;
peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, dylan, hunter, casey]</span>
</code>
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      The safer way to add an element is by asking the array
      to add it for you. To do this you ask the array
      to "push" a new element "on top" of the current list.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
var taylor = new Person();
peopleAllergicToNuts.push(taylor);
peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, dylan, hunter, casey, taylor]</span>
</code>
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      Generally, arrays are smarter than they appear. They have the ability to manipulate themselves,
      like adding or removing elements, as well as the ability to communicate information that we may
      find useful. For instance, an array has the ability to tell us how many elements it has at
      any given moment. We can rely on these features to build safer code.
    </p>


    <h2>Changing elements in an array</h2>

    <p>
      There will be times when you need to change an existing element
      in an array. Say, for instance, our buddy Dylan has suddenly been cured,
      and at the exact same moment we found out that our friend Blake is horribly
      allergic and will die at the simple touch of a nut.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's use what we know to replace Dylan with Blake.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
<code>
var blake = new Person();
peopleAllergicToNuts[2] = blake;
peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, blake, hunter, casey, taylor];</span>
</code>
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      Notice how the third element (index 2), <code>dylan</code>, was replaced by our new friend, <code>blake</code>.
    </p>

  </div>
