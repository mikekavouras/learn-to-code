    <h1> Array (Collection, List)</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Wikipedia:</b> Generally, a collection of data items that can
      be selected by indices computed at run-time.

    <p>
      An array, in its simplest form, is a <b>collection of things</b> (elements).
    </p>

    <p>
      An array keeps its elements inside of a left bracket and a
      right bracket, like this: <code>[]</code>
    </p>


    <p>
      Let's create a new <b>empty array</b> with and assign it to
      the variable <code>emptyArray</code>.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>

<code>var emptyArray = [];</code>

</pre>
</div>


    <p>
      The variable <code>emptyArray</code> is now referencing a new array with 0 elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      In theory, an array can contain infinite elements. In reality, however,
      the number of elements in an array is limited by the memory of the
      computer. Each element inside of an array is separated by a comma.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>

<code>var newArray = [thing1, thing2, thing3, thing4]; </code>

</pre>
</div>


    <p>
      A practical example of an array would be a collection of people.
      Let's say we have group of friends who are allergic to nuts. It would be nice
      if we had a way to keep track of these friends so that can ensure that they
      are never served nuts.
    </p>


<div class="code">
<pre>

<code>var sam = new Person();
var alex = new Person();
var dylan = new Person();
var hunter = new Person();

var peopleAllergicToNuts = [sam, alex, dylan, hunter];</code>

</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      Now we have an array containing all of our friends who
      are allergic to nuts. Next time we're ordering lunch, we
      can make sure that these friends eat nut free.
