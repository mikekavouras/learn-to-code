    <h2>Accessing elements in an array</h2>

    <p>
      In order to remember which of our friends are allergic to nuts,
      we need a way to retrieve the elements from our array.
      The elements of an array are accessed with a special property
      called an <u>index</u>. An index is nothing more than the numeric
      position of an element. The only catch is that this index doesn't
      start at 1, it starts at 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's try and access the first person who is allergic to nuts and
      assign it to a new variable, <code>firstAllergicPerson</code>.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>

<code>var firstAllergicPerson = peopleAllergicToNuts[0]; <span class="comment">// sam</span></code>

</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      Notice the <u>syntax</u>. We're using the name of the variable referencing
      our array, <code>peopleAllergicToNuts</code> followed by <code>[0]</code>. The brackets
      tell our array that we're attempting to access an element.
      The 0 is the index of the element we're attempting to access
      (remember, our indices begin at 0, not 1).
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>

<code>peopleAllergicToNuts[0]; <span class="comment">// sam</span>
peopleAllergicToNuts[1]; <span class="comment">// alex</span>
peopleAllergicToNuts[2]; <span class="comment">// dylan</span>
peopleAllergicToNuts[3]; <span class="comment">// hunter</span>
peopleAllergicToNuts[4]; <span class="comment">// ?????? (UH OH)</span></code>

</pre>
</div>

    <h3>????? (UH OH)</h3>

    <p>
      There are times when you'll attempt to access an element that
      doesn't exist (the last line in the example above). This can
      be very problematic. Certain programs will crash, while others
      will just make your code unstable. We'll go over
      ways to prevent this later. In the meantime, don't do it.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding elements to an array</h2>

    <p>
      Often you'll find yourself wanting to add new elements to an
      array. Say we discover than our other friend, Casey, is also
      allergic to nuts. There are a few ways add new elements to
      an array. One way is to use an explicit index.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>

<code>peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, dylan, hunter]</span>

var casey = new Person();
peopleAllergicToNuts[4] = casey;
peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, dylan, hunter, casey]</span></code>

</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      The safer way to add an element is by asking the array
      to add it for you. To do this you ask the array
      to "push" a new element "on top" of the current list.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>

<code>peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, dylan, hunter, casey]</span>

var taylor = new Person();
peopleAllergicToNuts.push(taylor);
peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, dylan, hunter, casey, taylor]</span></code>

</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      Generally, arrays are smarter than they appear. They have the ability to manipulate themselves,
      like adding or removing elements, as well as the ability to communicate information that we may
      find useful. For instance, an array has the ability to tell us how many elements it has at
      any given moment. We can rely on these features to build safer code.
    </p>


    <h2>Changing elements in an array</h2>

    <p>
      There will be times when you need to change an existing element
      in an array. Say, for instance, our buddy Dylan has suddenly been cured,
      and at the exact same moment we found out that our friend Blake is horribly
      allergic and will die at the simple touch of a nut.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's use what we know to replace Dylan with Blake.
    </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>

<code>peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, dylan, hunter, casey, taylor];</span>

var blake = new Person();
peopleAllergicToNuts[2] = blake;
peopleAllergicToNuts; <span class="comment">// [sam, alex, blake, hunter, casey, taylor];</span></code>

</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      Notice how the third element (index 2), <code>dylan</code>, was replaced by our new friend, <code>blake</code>.
    </p>

  </div>
